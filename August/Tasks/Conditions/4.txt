You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

Test Cases:
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] ->  11
[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] -> 160

[8811272, 9218790, 9094178, -818772, 2711934, -3905606, 1332109] -> 1332109
